# Student's Performance 


## Dataset Overview

🔍 This Power BI dashboard analyzes the performance of senior students from a **fictional large high school** at the end of their final semester, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. It examines how various factors, such as absenteeism, study habits, and career aspirations, impact academic outcomes.

## Data Credibility

**Reliable:**  The current dataset is accurate and complete. Regarding bias, while the dataset appears accurate and complete, determining bias requires a deeper understanding of the data collection methods and potential underlying assumptions. Bias can stem from various sources, including sample selection, measurement processes, or inherent stereotypes. Without detailed information on these aspects, it's challenging to conclusively identify or rule out biases.

**Original:** The data was downloaded from Kaggle but was originally sourced from Sling Academy.

**Comprehensive:** Contains all essential information needed to answer key questions.

**Current:** Not up to date, as the last update was on August 15, 2023.

**Cited:** The data is cited because it includes a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and references Sling Academy as the original source.


## Grading System 

🔗: https://www.slingacademy.com/article/student-scores-sample-data-csv-json-xlsx-xml/

In this project, the dataset's author specifies that the grading system follows the United States' 0–100 scale, with corresponding letter grades:

A: 90–100 (Excellent)

B: 80–89 (Good)

C: 70–79 (Satisfactory or Average)

D: 60–69 (Below Average)

F: 0–59 (Fail)

Based on this clarification, I applied conditional formatting rules and assigned icons to table columns accordingly.


## Research Questions 

1. Is there a significant difference in GPA between male and female students?

2. How does school absence affect a student’s performance?

4. How are weekly self-study hours related to students' GPA?

5. Which subjects show the highest average scores?

6. Does working a part-time job impact self-study hours and, in turn, GPA?

7. Is there any difference in absenteeism between boys and girls?
