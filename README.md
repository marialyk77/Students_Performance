# Student's Performance 



This Power BI dashboard, sourced from a Kaggle dataset, analyzes school students' performance by exploring how various factors impact academic outcomes. 


The project addresses the following research questions:

1. How does school absence affect a studentâ€™s performance?

2. How are weekly self-study hours related to students' GPA?

3. Which subjects show the highest average scores?

4. Does working a part-time job impact self-study hours and, in turn, GPA?

5. Is there any difference in absenteeism between boys and girls?

The dashboard uses a combination of KPI cards, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to provide actionable insights for educators and school administrators.
