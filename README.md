**3. Is there any difference in absenteeism between boys and girls?**

Yes, there are some differences in absenteeism between genders.

- The 100% stacked bar chart on absenteeism by gender shows that both males and females have similar absenteeism levels, but there may be slight variations in the distribution.
- However, since GPA is similar between genders, absenteeism differences may not be drastic enough to create performance gaps.

✅ **Conclusion:** There are slight absenteeism differences, but they do not significantly impact gender-based GPA trends.

**4. Does working a part-time job impact self-study hours and, in turn, GPA?**

The clustered bar chart suggests that part-time work does not have a major impact on GPA.

- Students with part-time jobs appear to have similar GPA trends as those without jobs, especially when self-study hours are controlled.
- However, time management could be a factor—students balancing work and studies may need to optimize their schedules.

✅ **Conclusion:** Part-time jobs do not significantly impact GPA, but effective time management remains important.

## Data Processing & Optimization

The dataset was **clean and complete**, with no missing values, duplicates, or nulls. To enhance analysis, several calculated columns were added, including overall GPA, derived as the average across all course columns.

**Absenteeism levels** were defined using a conditional column, categorizing students based on the maximum absenteeism days (10):

- Low Absenteeism: ≤3 days
- Moderate Absenteeism: ≤7 days
- High Absenteeism: >7 days

## Modeling 

To optimize performance, two dimensional tables (Career Aspiration & Gender) were created and merged with the fact table using a common key. This approach reduces redundancy and aligns with best practices for performance optimization.

## Vizualization 

### Bar Graphs on KPI cards 

The bar graphs provide additional context for the KPI cards. The average GPA performance of males and females was compared against their own expected range, defined by the 25th and 75th percentile benchmarks for each gender.

Key Components:

- Target Min GPA (Left Section): The 25th percentile (lower boundary of expected range).
- Target Range (Middle Section): The expected GPA range (25th–75th percentile).
- Axis Fill (Right Section): The gap between the 75th percentile and the actual average GPA.
- Constant Line: Represents the average GPA for males in the male visual and females in the female visual.

This method ensures a fair comparison, highlighting how each gender performs relative to their own distribution rather than an overall benchmark.



### Bar Graph - Avg Course Score 

For the bar graph showing GPA per course, a separate aggregate table was created instead of unpivoting the original fact table. This prevents an excessive number of rows per student, ensuring a more efficient data structure.



### Tooltip Histogram 

To categorize student performance visually, a histogram was created using GPA bins based on the U.S. grading system:

- A (90–100): Excellent
- B (80–89): Good
- C (70–79): Satisfactory/Average
- D (60–69): Below Average
- F (0–59): Fail

The bin configuration used 5 bins, aligning with these grading categories. However, due to the dataset’s minimum GPA (59.14) and maximum GPA (96.14), the bins were adjusted to 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, and 90-100. The lowest bin (50-60) compensates for the absence of GPAs below 50, ensuring the full range is covered.
